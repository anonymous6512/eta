# Can we Communicate? Using Dynamic Logic to Verify Team Automata

This project is a temporary repository to host to tools of an ETA analysis, anonymised for a blind submission to FM 2023.
To run the tools, you can either:

 1. Navigate to https://anonymous6512.github.io/eta, or
 2. Download this repository and open `index.html` locally

Unfortunatelly option (1) of this anonymised version may not work on your browser, due to `http` links from a `https` GitHub-hosted website. In that case you will have to use option (2).
